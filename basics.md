### Basics of Angular:

When discussing the basics, we're mainly looking at understanding the foundational concepts that form the bedrock of Angular applications. These are:

#### 1.1. **What is Angular and its architecture?**
- **Angular**: It's a platform and framework for building client-side applications with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
  
- **Architecture**: An Angular application is a combination of:
  - **Modules**: Angular apps are modular and Angular has its own modularity system called `NgModules`.
  - **Components**: These define views, which are sets of screen elements. Every Angular application has at least one component, the root component.
  - **Templates**: This defines the views associated with Angular components.
  - **Services and Dependency Injection**: For data-sharing between parts of your application.

For our Online Learning Platform:

**Modules**:
- `AppModule`: Root module.
- `UserModule`: For user-related features (Profile, Registrations, etc.).
- `CourseModule`: For course-related features.
- `AdminModule`: For admin functionalities.

**Components**:
- `AppComponent`: Root component.
- Within `UserModule`: `UserProfileComponent`, `UserRegistrationComponent`, `UserLoginComponent`, etc.
- Within `CourseModule`: `CourseListComponent`, `CourseDetailComponent`, `CourseCardComponent`, etc.
- Within `AdminModule`: `AddCourseComponent`, `EditCourseComponent`, etc.

#### 1.2. **Setting up a new Angular project using Angular CLI**
- Start by installing Angular CLI globally: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- Create a new project: `ng new online-learning-platform`
- Navigate into the directory and serve the app: `cd online-learning-platform` & `ng serve`
- The default application will be accessible at `http://localhost:4200/`.

#### 1.3. **Understanding of Components, Modules, and Templates**

- **Components**: Each component is a logical piece of UI. For instance:
  - `HeaderComponent`: Would contain the application header, possibly with navigation.
  - `CourseCardComponent`: Would display a single course's summary, to be used in a list.

- **Modules**: Organize related components, directives, and services under a single block. They provide a compilation context for components. For instance:
  - `CourseModule`: Would encapsulate all the features and functionalities related to courses.

- **Templates**: This is the part written in HTML which dictates how the component should render on the UI. For the `CourseCardComponent`, the template might show a course title, image, instructor, and a short description.

#### 1.4. **Data Binding - One Way and Two Way Binding**

- **One-way binding**: It's when data flows only in one direction. For example, displaying a course title on the UI from the component's data.

  ```html
  <h2>{{ course.title }}</h2>
  ```

- **Two-way binding**: It's when data flows in both directions. For example, a user updates their profile information, and the input field is bound to a component property. Any changes in the input field will update the property and vice versa.

  ```html
  <input [(ngModel)]="user.name">
  ```

In our platform, one-way binding can be used to display course details, user info, etc., while two-way binding can be utilized in profile edit forms, course creation by admin, and more.

These foundational concepts are pivotal to grasping the more advanced aspects of Angular. As you move forward with developing the platform, ensuring you're solid on these basics will facilitate a smoother development process.
